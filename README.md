# Clinical DBS Annotator

A desktop application for annotating Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) clinical programming sessions. Built with PyQt5 for clinicians and researchers working with DBS systems (Medtronic Percept and others).

**Version:** 0.3 (testing)
**Author:** Lucia Poma (lpoma@mgh.harvard.edu) — Brain Modulation Lab, MGH

## For End Users

**No installation required.** Download the pre-built executable and run it directly:

1. Go to the `dist/` folder
2. Run `ClinicalDBSAnnot_v0_3_testing.exe`
3. That's it — the application opens immediately

The executable is self-contained and includes all dependencies.

## What It Does

The application guides you through a DBS programming session in three steps:

1. **Initial Setup** — Select output file, electrode model, initial stimulation parameters, and baseline clinical scales
2. **Session Scales** — Choose which scales to track during the session (Mood, Anxiety, Energy, etc.)
3. **Active Recording** — Adjust stimulation parameters in real-time, record scale values at each timepoint, add notes, and export a clinical report

There is also a **Free Annotations** mode for quick timestamped text annotations without the full stimulation workflow.

### Key Features

- **Electrode visualization** with interactive contact selection (supports directional leads)
- **Clinical scale presets** for OCD, MDD, PD, ET
- **BIDS-compliant file naming** (sub-XX_ses-YYYYMMDD_task-programming_run-XX_events.tsv)
- **Export to Word** with electrode configuration images, clinical notes, and session data tables
- **Dark/Light theme** toggle
- **Timestamps aligned** with Medtronic Percept data (Eastern Time)

### Output Format

Data is saved as TSV with columns: `date`, `time`, `block_id`, `is_initial`, `session_ID`, `electrode_model`, `scale_name`, `scale_value`, stimulation parameters (frequency, contacts, amplitude, pulse width per side), `group`, and `notes`.

### Building the Executable

```bash
# Windows
python scripts/build_windows.py

# Windows with console (for debugging)
python scripts/build_windows.py --console

# macOS
python scripts/build_macos.py
```

The executable is created in the `dist/` folder. Distribute this file — no Python installation needed on the target machine.

### Running Tests

```bash
pytest
