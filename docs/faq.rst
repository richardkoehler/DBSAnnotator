Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

General
-------

**Does the application require an internet connection?**

No.  The application is fully offline.  It only reads and writes local files.

**Is my patient data sent anywhere?**

No.  All data stays on your local machine.  No telemetry, no cloud sync.

**Which DBS systems are supported?**

The application is system-agnostic for data recording.  Electrode visualisation
supports leads from Medtronic (including Percept PC / RC), Abbott (Infinity),
and Boston Scientific (Vercise) families.  If your lead is not listed, use the
closest equivalent or contact the development team to request it be added.

**Can I use the application on a shared clinical workstation?**

Yes.  The application does not require installation and writes no registry
entries.  You can run it directly from a USB drive or a shared network folder.

----

Files & Data
------------

**Where are my data files saved?**

In the folder you selected in Step 0 of the session workflow.  The application
never writes files outside that folder.

**Can I open the TSV files in Excel?**

Yes.  In Excel: *File → Open*, select the ``.tsv`` file, and in the Text Import
Wizard choose **Tab** as the delimiter.

Alternatively, double-click the file — Windows may open it in Excel
automatically if Excel is installed.

**Can I edit the TSV file manually?**

You can, but be careful:

* Do not change column headers.
* Do not delete or reorder rows.
* Do not change the ``is_initial`` values.
* Save as Tab-delimited TSV, not as ``.xlsx``.

**What happens if the application crashes mid-session?**

All entries are written to disk immediately as they are recorded.  You will not
lose any data that was successfully recorded before the crash.  Reopen the
application, start a new session pointing to the same folder, and the existing
file will be detected.

**Can I merge two TSV files from the same session?**

Manually: open both files in a text editor and copy the rows from the second
file (excluding the header row) to the end of the first.  Make sure block IDs
are unique after merging.

Reports
-------

**The report generation dialog asks about scale optimisation.  What is that?**

The application highlights the "best" stimulation configuration in green in the
Session Data table.  The scale optimisation dialog lets you define what "best"
means for each scale:

* **Min** — the entry with the lowest value is best (e.g. UPDRS — lower motor
  score = better).
* **Max** — the entry with the highest value is best (e.g. Mood VAS — higher
  mood = better).
* **Custom** — the entry closest to a target value you specify.

Uncheck a scale to exclude it from the calculation.

**The report sections dialog appeared but I only want a summary table.
Which sections should I check?**

Check only **Sessions Overview** (for a quick one-table overview) or
**Programming Summary** (for parameter ranges).  Uncheck the others.

**Word export works but PDF export fails.**

PDF conversion requires Microsoft Word to be installed on the machine, or
LibreOffice in headless mode.  If neither is available:

1. Export as Word (``.docx``) instead.
2. Open the ``.docx`` in Word and print to PDF manually (*File → Export →
   Create PDF/XPS*).

**The electrode diagrams are missing from the report.**

This happens when the electrode model field is empty in the TSV.  Ensure that
you selected an electrode model in Step 1 before recording entries.

----

Troubleshooting
---------------

**The application does not start / shows a black window.**

Try running it as administrator (right-click → *Run as administrator*).  This
is sometimes needed on machines with strict execution policies.

**The application is very slow on first launch.**

Windows Defender or other antivirus software may be scanning the executable.
Add the application folder to your antivirus exclusion list.

**I see "No session data found" when trying to export a longitudinal report.**

Check that:

* At least one ``.tsv`` file is loaded.
* The loaded files contain rows with ``is_initial = 0`` (session entries, not
  just baseline).
* The files are not empty or corrupted.

**The scale optimisation dialog shows no scales.**

The longitudinal report requires at least one session file with recorded scale
values (``scale_name`` and ``scale_value`` columns populated) in
``is_initial = 0`` rows.  If your files only contain initial entries, the
dialog cannot compute best-entry highlighting — proceed by clicking OK without
making any selection.
